    <h1> WORKSHOPS CONDUCTED </h1>   
    <p> IEEE SIES Graduate School of Technology had organised a workshop on the topic IOT using Intel Galileo microcontroller. Intel Galileo combines Intel technology with support for Arduino ready-made hardware expansion cards (called "shields") and the Arduino software development environment and libraries. The development board runs an open source Linux operating system with the Arduino software libraries. It was a two day workshop conducted on 29TH and 30th of July 2017. This workshop was conducted by Mr. Niraj Kapse under IOT-PRO .This workshop was attended by 11 teams and each team consists of 4 members. This workshop was conducted for students solely to enhance their technical knowledge. Workshop is attended by Prof. Pushkar Sathe, Prof. Kintu Patel & Prof. Vishal Gaikwad. It started off with basic knowledge of different microcontrollers and components which were provided to each team. The kits provided to the attendees included Intel Galileo microcontroller, varieties of sensors and datasheets along with it. Then there was a session on over all knowledge about IOT and how it can be used on different platforms. The students were given the hands on implementation of the devices with basics of programming and it was implemented using software system. There was a complete session on the usage of sensors and how it can be interfaced with microcontroller. The second day of workshop was based on how to send data to the cloud from Internet-enabled device using Ubidots which was very interesting. Ubidots offers a platform for developers that enable them to easily capture sensor data and turn it into useful information. It was a very interactive workshop. The concept of IOT was pretty much understood by the students and thus it turned out be technically educative workshop.</p>
    <p> The student chapter of IEEE SIES GST organized a ‘Hand on workshop for Drone Making’ on 27/8/2016. It was a one day workshop and was delivered by 3 speakers Apurva Godbole, Dinesh Sain, Prasanna Shevare.
        The workshop was conducted by DRONA AVIATION, which is a SINE IIT Bombay incubated robotics company. The students could inherit complete hand on experience in making the quadcopter as they were guided by the speakers on how to build a quadcopter and also explained them the various mechanics behind the building of a quadcopter. Finally when the construction part was completed they were instructed regarding the operations of quadcopter as well. The session was full of new learning and experiences for students who attended.</p>
 
  
   <h1> INDUSTRIAL VISITS </h1> 
   <p>  All the students assembled in the college premises by 7:30 am. After marking their attendance the trip began by 8 am sharp. The journey from Navi Mumbai to Pune was a road journey and we reached the destination at 11:30 am. After a while of rest and refreshments, the students were addressed by CEO and Founder of ISTC Mr. Krish Mehkarkar. He primarily focused on gaining a working knowledge of different devices in a general RF system. To begin the proceedings, video screenings of PSLV and GSLV animations were shown. They particularly focused on identifying different components of the launch vehicle. Later, various videos were shown to demonstrate ISRO's space development programs and missions. Mr. Krish Mehkarkar interacted with the students on topics such as Earth stations and antenna positioning parameters. One of the main highlights was the lecture delivery being very easy to comprehend and proper reasoning behind every concept being explained. The lecture concluded on a promising note to perform the practical of the topics which had been taught. After the students were through with their lunch, they were shown the components inside a set-top box and the functioning of each basic sub-system was explained by the industry coordinators. The second phase of the practical was to showcase the different antennas which included 9m Earth Station Antenna, 6m Receive Antenna and 3.8 m Trans/Receive Antenna. Students were informed about the installation and working of Antenna Control Systems, RF Equipment (Uplink & Downlink) like SSPA, HPA, UP/DOWN Converters, Modulators, Demodulators & Uplink Power Controllers and RF cabling. The key aspect of this industrial visit was that the students realized the importance of moving beyond the theoretical knowledge of satellite communication and applying them in functional devices to understand it’s working. Mr. Krish Mehkarkar again focused on the fact that the best way to learn the working of a certain device was to be able to install, configure and troubleshoot it rather than only having a theoretical know-how. Thus, the Industrial Visit ended on a positive note with proper co-ordination of the whole team of IEEE SIESGST.</p>
   
   
   <h1> TECHNICAL EVENTS </h1>
   <p> Circuit Maniacs was one of the new events added this year in Techopedia. This event was exclusively for 1st and the 2nd year students conducted on 24th of September 2016. This also included several rounds with a twist. This event was not only based on circuit designing but also had some fun filled rounds. The top three winners were given certificates and prize.</p>
